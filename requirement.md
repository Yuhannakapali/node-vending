Vending Machine
We need to build a vending machine where one can just insert the coin and get back the desired drinks. The drinks at the vending machine can be purchased and refunded. The clear specs have been listed below -:
Specs
1. There are only three products available at the moment Coke cost (Rs 20), Pepsi cost (Rs 25), and Dew cost (Rs 30)
2. If the currency entered is less than the actual cost the vending machine should not process further.
3. If the amount entered is higher than the actual cost the vending machine should calculate the cost and return the change
4. When purchased the stock of item should be decreased and the amount of coins should increase
5. The items can be refunded which will increase the item stock and decrease the amount of coin
6. Initial stock for items Coke 10, Pepsi 10, Dew 10 and the initial amount of total coins 100
7. Consider the cases when the vending machine is out of coins or out of the products
8. People can enter any amount of coin so there are no any restriction but however we will be planning to accept cash (You do not need to implement cash payment) in future. So make sure your code is flexible enough for future features too
What we will focus on when evaluating the task
How well you design the system
How well do you create Apis
How good your knowledge of OOP or functional programming is
Clarity and Readability in code
How well you follow some coding principles like SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, etc and how you use design patterns to accomplish the task
How well you write your tests
How well you write Readme
What we want you to do
Use of any Js frameworks (Ts preferred)
Use REST API standards
Use in-memory state or any DB or file to store the state
Write unit / integration tests
Write down your assumptions
Create private GitHub repo and submit your code make sure you create a proper history of branches/commits, think like you are building a real product
Bonus Points
Dockerized application
Use of frontend js libraries to make a UI purchase and refund from a vending machine (You can use existing templates from material ui or ant design to save your time)
